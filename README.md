## What is "Docker"

Docker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public  or private cloud.[10] When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel  and a union-capable file system to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.[12] Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.
